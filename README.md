# rmn2arbc

> Roman Number to Arabic Number convertor

A CLI app to convert a roman number into arabic number.

## Motivation

This programme was developed during my college days in 2006 using **Turbo C++** as a module of my final year project. The motivation behind this project is to create plugable utility tool for another project.

## Build

You can build this program as an executable file or a WebAssembly binary (WASI). Since WASI binary is cross-platform, so we'll go with that.

To build this program as a WASI (WebAssembly System Interface), you need to have the WASI SDK installed on your system. The WASI SDK is a collection of tools and libraries that enable you to compile and run WebAssembly programs on different platforms. You can follow the instructions from [wasi-sdk-setup](https://github.com/isurfer21/wasi-sdk-setup) to set up the WASI SDK.

To compile the source code file `rmn2arbc.cpp` into a WebAssembly binary file `rmn2arbc.wasm`, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
wasi clang++ rmn2arbc.cpp -o rmn2arbc.wasm
```

This will create a file named `rmn2arbc.wasm` in the same directory as the source code file.

## Usage

To execute this program as a WASI, you need to have [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://wasmtime.dev/).

To run the WebAssembly binary file `rmn2arbc.wasm`, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```cmd
wasmtime rmn2arbc.wasm
```

It will ask you to enter a roman number. Then it converts the roman number into equivalent arabic number and show the result on the screen. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

## Limitations

- The app only supports roman numerals up to 3999. Larger numbers are not supported by the standard roman numeral system.
- The app does not validate the input. Invalid or malformed roman numerals may produce unexpected results or errors.
- The app does not handle exceptions or errors gracefully. If an error occurs, the app may crash or terminate abruptly.
