# rmn2arbc

> Roman Number to Arabic Number convertor

A CLI app to convert a roman number into arabic number.

## Motivation

This programme was developed during my college days in 2006 using **Turbo C++** as a module of my final year project. The motivation behind this project is to create plugable utility tool for another project.

## Install

This program was developed using Turbo C++ compiler on Windows XP. To run it on modern systems, you may need to use a DOS emulator like DOSBox. You can download Turbo C++ from [here](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/) and DOSBox from [here](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1).

## Build

To compile a program using Turbo C++, you can use the command line utility `tcc`. For example, if your program is named `rmn2arbc.cpp`, you can type `tcc rmn2arbc.cpp` in the command prompt to compile it. 

You may need to set up some environment variables to find header files and libraries. You can also use the Turbo C++ editor and press **Alt-F9** or go to the **Compile** tab and select **Compile** or **Build All**. 

If the compilation is successful, you will find an executable file with the same name as your program, such as `rmn2arbc.exe`. You can run it using a DOS emulator like DOSBox or directly from the Turbo C++ editor by pressing **Ctrl-F9** or going to the **Run** tab and selecting **Run**.

## Usage

Execute the program via running this command.

```cmd
.\rmn2arbc.exe
```

It will ask you to make a move & will show the result on the screen. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
